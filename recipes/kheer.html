    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kheer, also called payasam, a chilled South Asian dessert made from slow-cooked rice, milk, and sugar, much like a rice pudding. It is typically flavoured with saffron, cardamom, raisins, and/or various nuts, notably pistachios, cashews, and almonds.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        
        <li>2 cups coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup Basmati rice</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
